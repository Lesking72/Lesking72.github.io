        <h1>F.A.Q</h1>
            <h2>Does this cache for offline use?</h2>
                No.
            <h2>Can you add X?</h2>
                Probably not. This is mostly a stop-gap until the usual sources update their hosts.
            <h2>Is there a self-host version?</h2>
                If you ask for it.
            <h2>What on earth is that styling?</h2>
                Not sure.
            <h2>When I click a button it just gives me a 404 / the exploit never loads!</h2>
                Make sure the URL has a trailing / at the end or the relative paths won't work.<br>
                It should look like https://lesking72.github.io/ps4/, or 10.0.0.153/ps4/ or 10.0.0.153/ or however you host it.<br>
                If you did that and it's still broken, I probably broke it. Complain to Les#5465.
            <h2>Who all made this happen?</h2>
                David Miller - HEN page, which was modified for everything else<br>
                ChendoChap - The HEN itself, and the netcat page<br>
                Synacktiv - WebKit exploit<br>
                Sleirsgoevy - ported the WebKit exploit to 7.02<br>
                Andy Nguyen - kernel exploit<br>
                SpecterDev, kiwidog, Fire30 and SocraticBliss were also involved.
