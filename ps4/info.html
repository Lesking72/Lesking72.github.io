        <h1>Questions you probably don't have</h1>
            <h2>Does this cache for offline use?</h2>
				<div class=ind>
					Yes. Cache status is displayed in the footer the first time the menu loads, and every time the cache is being updated.<br>
					If you have cache issues, clear ALL your browser data, power off (not restart) and try again.
				</div>
			<h2>What are the 'untested' payloads?</h2>
				<div class=ind>
					'untested' simply means I haven't tested them. So I can't speak as to whether they work on this exploit host<br>
					(or if they work at all). If you've tested one, please drop me a line.
				</div>
			<h2>Can you add X?</h2>
                <div class=ind>
					Probably not, but it never hurts to ask. This is mostly a stop-gap until the usual sources update their hosts.
				</div>
			<h2>Is there a self-host version?</h2>
                <div class=ind>
				<a href="https://lesking72.github.io/ps4/selfhost.zip">https://lesking72.github.io/ps4/selfhost.zip</a>. It can be hosted with a server such as <a href="http://miniweb.sourceforge.net/">MiniWeb</a>
				</div>
			<h2>What on earth is that styling?</h2>
                <div class=ind>
					heh, tech tips
				</div>
			<h2>Do I really need to restart after each failure?</h2>
				<div class=ind>
					If you get an "Out of memory" error, you can dismiss it and let the page reload to try again. If you get any other<br>
					error, restart the console through the quick menu or using the power button on the console. Don't close the dialog box,<br>
					because that usually results in a panic.
				</div>
			<h2>Should the screen go black when starting Mira?</h2>
				<div class=ind>
					Mira restarts the shell when it loads, this behavior is normal.
				</div>
			<h2>Whats X in the debug settings?</h2>
				<div class=ind>
					If you don't know what something does, don't touch it.
				</div>
			<h2>What's IDU mode?</h2>
				<div class=ind>
					Store demo mode. It automatically updates the firmware, which will leave you stuck in<br>
					IDU mode because you won't be able to access the debug settings to turn it off.<br>
					<b>DON'T ENABLE IDU MODE OR YOU'LL BE STUCK ON THE LATEST FIRMWARE, AND IN IDU MODE.</b><br>
					If you enabled it and had your firmware update, the only thing you can do is put your PS4<br>
					in the back of a closet until an exploit is released for the version it updated to.
				</div>
